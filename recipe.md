So the recipe of my Red Velvet Cake is :-

Step 1
To prepare this dessert recipe, start by making the frosting for which, in a bowl, add cream cheese and 1/2 cup butter. Whisk it well, until smooth. Now, add on the vanilla essence and then gradually stir in the icing sugar. Keep it aside for a while. You can also store the leftover in the refrigerator. If the mixture is thick, then add 1 teaspoon of water.

Step 2
For the cake, preheat the oven at 160 degree Celsius. Line a 9” round baking tin with oil and add flour, baking powder, baking soda and cocoa powder in it. Stir it well and then set it side. In a large bowl, whip together condensed milk and 1/2 cup of butter. Whisk it until the mixture is creamy and add red food color to it. Whisk it again until it is smooth.

Step 3
Now, add flour mixture to the condensed milk mixture gradually, in small batches, while stirring it constantly. Add yogurt along with 1 teaspoon icing sugar, apple cider vinegar and whisk for another 2 minutes, until it attains a batter-like consistency. Don’t over whisk the batter. Pour the batter in the tin and bake it in a preheated oven for 30 minutes. Bake until the knife or toothpick comes out clean. Once done, let it cool and top up with cream cheese frosting to enjoy!
